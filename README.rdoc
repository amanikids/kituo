This is an internal application used by social workers at the Amani Children's
Home in Moshi, TZ. Its primary function is to schedule and keep track of home
visits.

== Quick start

  brew install imagemagick
  brew install postgresql
  bundle
  rake .environment
  rake db:setup
  rake

== Roles

=== Social worker

There are about 5 social workers at Amani. They want to:

* Schedule home visits, either to try and arrange a reunification of a child
  with their extended family, or to check up on such an arrangement. This
  normally happens every month or so - see the RecommendedVisit model for
  typical guidelines.

* Print a roll call sheet for all kids on site

=== Social work coordinator

Manages the social workers. Traditionally just one. They want to:

* Get an overview of how long kids are staying at Amani
* Assign kids to social workers

=== Development officer

Traditionally just one. They want to:

* Get an overview of how long kids are staying at Amani
* Upload headshots of the kids

== Design

* As this is an internal app, Firefox is the only browser that needs to be
  supported.

* Authentication is not required - social workers often masquerade as others
  when they are on leave - and there is no private data. The identification
  page is for convenience and better usability (we can provide a home page that
  is directly useful to the person).

* Average computer competence of users is low, so the UI is designed to be big
  and friendly. Drag and drop is used liberally as it was the easiest for
  social workers to use.

* Selenium tests cover all the functionality, including the JS drag-drop stuff
  which is kind of neat.

* The app is localized to Swahili and English.

* African names typically aren't as strict as English ones. Spelling is quite
  variable. To try and alleviate the problem of multiple case files for the
  same person, an algorithm is used to suggest potential duplicates. Also,
  having a photo of the kids visible is quite important in this regard.
